<h2>Always have a cosy warm house!</h2>
<h3>Why our product</h3>
<p>This air heater system is designed to be easy to use and cost-effective in both the short and long term, as it controls the air heater in real time.</p>

<p>The control of the air heater is fully automated, making it suitable for all types of customers. A PI controller is used to adjust the air heater</p>

<p>to the desired temperature without any effort from the customer.</p>


<br>

<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>System description </p>

<p>Here is an overview of the system</p>
<img src="system.jpg" alt="System sketch" class="heater-img">

<p>The Arduino is connected to the air heater and controls it using a PI controller. A temperature sensor is used to continuously monitor the temperature.</p>

<p>Through a GUI application, the customer can adjust the temperature setpoint. The PI controller adjusts the input to the air heater until the</p>

<p>setpoint temperature is reached. Communication and data flow between the GUI and the air heater are handled through ThingSpeak, which reads and writes</p>

<p>data to and from the Arduino and the Visual Studio GUI.</p>


<P>Reading and writing channels in Thingspeak as showen in next figure :</P>

<p>The following table is showing the results of temperature controlling from a demo as the setpoint temperature sett by the customer increased or decreased </p>
